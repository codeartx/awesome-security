# $Id$
# The following includes information for prioritizing rules
# 
# Each classification includes a shortname, a description, and a default
# priority for that classification.
#
# This allows alerts to be classified and prioritized.  You can specify
# what priority each classification has.  Any rule can override the default
# priority for that rule.
#
# Here are a few example rules:
# 
#   alert TCP any any -> any 80 (msg: "EXPLOIT ntpdx overflow"; 
#	dsize: > 128; classtype:attempted-admin; priority:10;
#
#   alert TCP any any -> any 25 (msg:"SMTP expn root"; flags:A+; \
#	      content:"expn root"; nocase; classtype:attempted-recon;)
#
# The first rule will set its type to "attempted-admin" and override 
# the default priority for that type to 10.
#
# The second rule set its type to "attempted-recon" and set its
# priority to the default for that type.
