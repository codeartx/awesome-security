# OTHER-IDS RULES
# ---------------
# These signatures look for uses of other IDSs.
#
# These signatures serve two purposes.
#  1) If you are "IDS GUY" for a company, and someone else sets up an IDS
#     without letting you know, thats bad.
#  2) If you are "pen-tester", this is a good way to find out what IDS
#     systems your target is using after you have gained access to their
#     network.
